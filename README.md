# 0xScourgedev Portfolio

Hello! I am the Founding Fuzzing Engineer at [Perimeter](https://cantina.xyz/guilds/perimeter) and serve as a Fuzzing Engineer at [Guardian Audits](https://guardianaudits.com). I have developed comprehensive fuzzing suites for many notable projects, please see below. Previously, I acted as a technical team lead at a blockchain startup, which raised funds in the 7-figure range. I have also contributed to the development of smart contracts of large scale projects such as Parallel TCG.
